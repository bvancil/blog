## Things I...

### Things I do at work

- data science
- data visualization
- data cleaning and structuring
- pay equity studies. These are mostly linear regressions for legal interpretability.
- hierarchical time-series forecasting
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/) for version control
- [SAS](https://www.sas.com/) (base SAS 9.4) for data cleaning and analysis
- [Tableau](https://www.tableau.com/) (Desktop and Server)
- Oracle (database queries, Oracle Analytics Cloud (OAC), Oracle Business Intelligence Enterprise Edition (OBIEE), Data Visualization (DV))
- [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) for reports and presentations. Yes, [you can use SAS with Quarto](https://github.com/bvancil/quarto-sas-example).
- [Snakemake](https://snakemake.github.io/) for managing data pipelines
- [Nuance Dragon Naturally Speaking Professional](https://shop.nuance.com/) augmented with [Natlink](https://github.com/dictation-toolbox/natlink),  [Dragonfly](https://github.com/dictation-toolbox/dragonfly), and [Caster](https://github.com/dictation-toolbox/Caster) for dictating code and building grammars
- [AutoHotkey](https://www.autohotkey.com/) for combining with Caster to automate Windows interactions
- [Python](https://www.python.org) mostly for scripting these days
- [Sass: Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets](https://sass-lang.com/) and [Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)](https://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/Overview.en.html) for styling Quarto, SAS, and OAC
- [TeX/LaTeX/XeLaTeX](https://www.tug.org/)/[MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org/) for typesetting mathematics
- [Graphviz](https://graphviz.org/) and [Mermaid | Diagramming and charting tool](https://mermaid.js.org/) for diagrams

### Things I used to do at work

- [Stan](https://mc-stan.org/) for Bayesian hierarchical modeling
- [R](https://www.r-project.org/) (package development, data pipelines, [Shiny](https://www.rstudio.com/products/shiny/) dashboards)
- [Python](https://www.python.org) (data analysis, scripting, query generation)
- [dbt](https://www.getdbt.com/) to manage an analytic reporting schema and data pipelines
- [Asymptote](https://asymptote.sourceforge.io/) for creating diagrams for student worksheets

You can see a variety of my teaching blog posts at [Earth and Not-Earth | Teaching Earth & Space Science through Modeling](https://earthandnot.wordpress.com/) and [Fock Physics | Building up physics learning one state at a time](https://fockphysics.wordpress.com/).

### Things I do or have done for fun

- Programming

  - [Python](https://www.python.org)
  - [R Statistical Programming Language](https://www.r-project.org/)
